## Technologies Used

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Semantic and nested `<div>` structure to build the penguin and environment.
- CSS3:
  - Absolute positioning for layout
  - `linear-gradient` for color blending
  - `border-radius` for smooth shapes
  - `@keyframes` for continuous animation
  - Transformations and scaling for interactivity
- Responsive Design Principles: Ensures the penguin scales nicely across different screen sizes.
